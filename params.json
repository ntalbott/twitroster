{"body":"Twit Roster makes it easy to build an embeddable list of the latest tweets from\r\na roster of people. It was originally built as a hosted service, but since the\r\nhosted version is being end of lifed, I wanted to go ahead and make it available\r\nfor others to peruse if they so choose.\r\n\r\n## Tech\r\n\r\nThe service is just a little Sinatra app, and uses the file system to cache\r\nresponses from Twitter. No database, no Rails, etc.\r\n\r\n## Twitter\r\n\r\nI have no earthly idea how the app will play with all of Twitter's new API\r\nrules. Probably not very well. Maybe some brave soul could adapt it for App.Net?\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\nIf someone does get fired up about the code, I'd welcome (and point people to) a\r\nfork that takes over as the mainline. I won't be merging pull requests or\r\notherwise maintaining the project.\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nThis was a little hack project by the peeps at Terralien when Terralien was a\r\ngoing concern. [Richard Powell](http://samedis.com) and\r\n[myself](http://nathaniel.talbott.ws) collaborated on it in 2009, it was used\r\nfor a long while on the terralien.com home page, and a few people dropped it in\r\ntheir websites.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!

# Twit Roster

Twit Roster makes it easy to build an embeddable list of the latest tweets from
a roster of people. It was originally built as a hosted service, but since the
hosted version is being end of lifed, I wanted to go ahead and make it available
for others to peruse if they so choose.

# Tech

The service is just a little Sinatra app, and uses the file system to cache
responses from Twitter. No database, no Rails, etc.

# Twitter

I have no earthly idea how the app will play with all of Twitter's new API
rules. Probably not very well. Maybe some brave soul could adapt it for App.Net?

# Future

If someone does get fired up about the code, I'd welcome (and point people to) a
fork that takes over as the mainline. I won't be merging pull requests or
otherwise maintaining the project.

# About

This was a little hack project by the peeps at Terralien when Terralien was a
going concern. [Richard Powell](http://samedis.com) and
[myself](http://nathaniel.talbott.ws) collaborated on it in 2009, it was used
for a long while on the terralien.com home page, and a few people dropped it in
their websites.
